# Dominoes-Problem
This is a search problem where I made use of hash-tables and BST's to create the most efficient solution
# Project Explanation
We have a random set of dominoes and we want to match each domino to eachother E.g
- Unsorted Dominoes -   X:A , D:Z , D:A , B:X
- Sorted Dominoes   -   B:X , X:A , A:D , D:Z
- In order to sort we need to check both sides of the domino against every domino on both sides to find its match and produce the correct order
- In this project I get the best average case time complexity using Hash Tables and the best worst case time complexity using a binary search tree
# What I Learned and Improved on
- The use of unordered_maps for hash tables
- The use of unordered_sets for binary trees
- Getting the best time complexity
- Efficiency in searches
- Working with Files
- Timing Measuremnt in C++
- Complex Problem Solving
